%% All code in this MATLAB folder is provided free of
%% charge but also with no guarantees. Everything
%% works as far as I can tell though. Any modifications
%% to the code are done at the user's risk.  I request
%% that the following conditions be observed:

%% 1) Any modifications (except for angle and parameter
%%    changes in the init file, and correction of obvious errors)
%%    are clearly marked as such.
%% 2) The title credits of each file, along with
%%    this entire file, remain intact with the code.

%% It would also be nice if I could be at least partially
%% included in the research that this code is used for.

In this directory are all the files you need to 

 1) Simulate a simple point-foot walker with masses at the hip and feet, and
   show graphics output.

 2) Learn something about the dynamics of this interesting device.

The only necessary command is (in MATLAB)
>> run_doubpend

The files were created in MATLAB 5 and also run ( I think) in
MATLAB 4 with little or no fussing.
